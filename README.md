# hacker_tools: A collection of semi-useful hacking scripts
*by @hedgenull*


Includes:
- a [file encrypter/decrypter](/crypto.py)
- a [port scanner](/port_scanner.py) 
- a [reverse shell](/reverse_shell) that *might* work
- a [FTP password cracker](/ftp_cracker.py)
- a [fully functional keylogger](/keylogger.py)

I really appreciate Abdou Rockikz [(thepythoncode.com)](https://thepythoncode.com/) and his awesome articles that helped me make many of these!
